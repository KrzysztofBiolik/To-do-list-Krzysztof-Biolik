## How does the to-do list work?

The to-do list web page is a form that has one field for entering new tasks and a button that, when clicked, adds a new task and automatically sets the focus to the form field to be able to enter new tasks. The entered tasks appear in the form of a list, and each of them has two interaction buttons. The first button allows you to toggle the execution of the task. Completed tasks receive a strikethrough line for the task text. The second button allows you to remove tasks from the list.
