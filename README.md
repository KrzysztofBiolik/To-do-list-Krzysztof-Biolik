## How does the to-do list work?

The to-do list web page is a form that has one field for entering new tasks and a button that, when clicked, adds a new task and automatically sets the focus to the form field to be able to enter new tasks. The entered tasks appear in the form of a list, and each of them has two interaction buttons. The first button allows you to toggle the execution of the task. Completed tasks receive a strikethrough line for the task text. The second button allows you to remove tasks from the list.If the task list is not empty, two buttons appear. The first one is used to mark all tasks as completed. When all tasks are completed, this button is disabled. The second button is used to toggle the hiding of completed tasks.
